# Processing-based code that uses your MIDI controller data as a parameter of visualisations
This source code allow you to trigger visualisation changes in real-time using a MIDI controller such as a keyboard, pads, etc.

## Getting started
1. Install Processing 3.5.4 (this code doesn't work with Processing 4.x last time I checked).
2. Open the sketch within this repository using Processing, then write some code to use as another parameter to the visualisation (besides your MIDI controller).
3. Download [theMidiBus package](https://github.com/sparks/themidibus), preferably using Processing's _Contribution Manager_.
