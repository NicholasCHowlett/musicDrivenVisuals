# _Processing_ code that uses your MIDI controller data as a parameter of visualisations
This source code allow you to trigger visualisation changes in real-time using a MIDI controller (such as a keyboard, pads, etc), using a software-development (computer-programming) learning-environment called Processing.

## Getting started
1. Install [Processing 4.x](https://processing.org/download) (code was checked with Processing 4.1.1 which executed succesfully without errors).
2. Open the sketch within this repository using Processing, then write some code to use as another parameter to the visualisation (besides your MIDI controller).
3. Download then drag [micycle1's themidibus](https://github.com/micycle1/themidibus/releases) .jar file into Processing's editor, then save sketch.
